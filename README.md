# Linear Regression From Scratch
* A Linear Regression model developed in python from scratch - the algorithm itself is built solely with numpy and built-in Python modules;
* Developed in vector notation utilising numpy for a more efficient computational analysis;
* Includes a function to normalise the data (default only normalises the x-data);
* Outputs a graph of the cost vs the number of iterations, along with the number of iterations it took to converge;
* Outputs a graph of the data with along with the regression line;
* Outputs the $\text{R}^2$ to show how well the data fits the model.

## Code and Resources Used
**Python Version:** 3.8

**Packages:** numpy, pandas, matplotlib, scikit-learn (for splitting the data)
